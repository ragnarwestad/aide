// --- spec 90: a spec's phases fold away --------------------------------------
//
// Adding a row for every spec that has never run makes the list longer,
// and folding is what keeps it readable. The state is a query parameter,
// so it survives the five-second swap of the table by the mechanism the
// filter and the sort already ride on.
//
// Spec 103 turned the polarity round: the key is `open`, it names the
// rows shown EXPANDED, and a row nobody named is collapsed. The claims
// below are the same ones spec 90 made — one spec's fold state leaves
// the others alone, a key naming no spec is inert, every filter and
// sort link carries the state forward — asked of the new default.
