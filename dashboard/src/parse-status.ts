 *  status, and a skill that reads an unfinished `4-status.md` and
 *  declines exits just as successfully as one that moved the folder.
 *  So the skill writes the reason where it can be re-read — a
 *  `## Archive held back` section in the spec's own status file — and
 *  this reads it back. Same technique as `discover.ts`'s
 *  `specDescription` (find the heading, slice to the next heading or
 *  `---`), with `parseStatus`'s calling convention: the content, not a
 *  directory, because the caller already has the file in hand.
